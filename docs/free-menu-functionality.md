### Functionality

Free Menu release should have this screens:

- Login / sign-up
- About app tour
- View Menu(Recipe list)
- View Recipe data
- View settings
- Profile
- Recipe information short/extended (limited for different purposes)
- Recipes list AKA weekly menu analogue
- An app intro with images. We should install an npm module that have a predefined components, for app intro. We should put our content into it, test how it works, create a statement, so app intro opens only one time.But add an ability to run an intro again from user profile screen, just in case.  Images, Content, Screens should be created.
- Grocery List without additional logic, just a list of ingredients with checkboxes.
- Create a layout, for displaying a complex recipe.
- Move styles to separated place
- Display recipe directions
