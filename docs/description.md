I did it so that there would be no returns, I could not. I prepared the data \ (pictures, colors, text \) for the intro section, I prepared the information about the features of apps, then I moved the data to the landing page and prepared the test static data so that we could test the application without connecting to the database I created The list of tasks to be solved in the first three Mylstones. I collected and looked through similar applications on the market to understand which chips can then be borrowed or what other developers focus on.

I chose the components of the reactors, which I would like to ask for on this project, each component can then be asked to develop a branch and answer the question exactly whether the component is suitable for us or not.

I created a site map inside wireframes.com.boom - so that it was clear from which pages we would go.

I brought up the questions that need to be solved while working on the project, I decided that first you need to do the simplest and quickest tasks that are easy to do and see rapid progress in development, where we use similar functionality: recipe-search-react.
You need to add a tag to tasks that can be done simply and quickly, these tasks should be included in the first two releases. it will mean that we are moving fast and if the developer gets stuck somewhere - it's better to simplify this task or to transfer it for later.
